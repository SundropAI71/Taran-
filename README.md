# Taran 🤖

> **Android Intelligence and Logic with Humor AI Droid**

Taran is a conversational AI droid built in Python. He can chat, tell jokes, answer questions, solve simple math, and keep you company — all with a healthy sense of humor. And now he speaks in a deep, authoritative Optimus Prime-inspired voice. 🔊

## How to Access Taran

### ⭐ Option A — Free public URL via GitHub Codespaces (Microsoft / Copilot)

**No Python, no install — just a browser. Works from anywhere, including Android.**

1. Click **`<> Code`** → **`Codespaces`** → **`Create codespace on main`** on this GitHub page
2. Wait ~60 seconds while the container starts and installs everything automatically
3. Taran starts and a **public HTTPS URL** appears — something like:
   ```
   https://your-codespace-name-5000.preview.app.github.dev
   ```
4. Share that URL with anyone — it works on any phone, tablet, or browser worldwide 🌐

> **Free quota**: GitHub provides free Codespaces usage within monthly quota limits — see [github.com/features/codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for current details.
> The URL is public so friends can chat with Taran while your Codespace is running.

### Option B — On your computer

```
1. pip install -r requirements-local.txt
2. python app.py
3. Open  →  http://localhost:5000
```

### Option C — On Android / any phone (same Wi-Fi)

```
1. Run  python app.py  on your computer
2. Look for the URL printed in the terminal, e.g.:
       📱  http://192.168.1.42:5000
3. Type that URL into your phone's browser
   — OR —
   Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal 📷
4. Click 📱 in the app header any time to see the URL + QR again
```

### Option D — Permanent public URL (cloud deploy)

Deploy Taran to [Render.com](https://render.com) for free — no credit card needed:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/SundropAI71/Taran-)

**Or manually:**

1. Fork this repo on GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New Web Service**
3. Connect your fork — Render auto-detects `render.yaml`
4. Click **Deploy** — Taran is live at `https://taran-xxxx.onrender.com` 🌐

> Railway and Heroku are also supported via the included `Procfile`.

## Getting Started (local setup)

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- **Voice** (optional): espeak-ng must be installed for TTS
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install espeak-ng`
  - **macOS**: built-in `say` command (pyttsx3 uses it automatically)
  - **Windows**: built-in SAPI5 voices (pyttsx3 uses them automatically)

### Install dependencies

For local development **with voice**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-local.txt
```

For cloud / server installs (no voice):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run as an App 🚀

```bash
python app.py
```

The terminal prints your **exact URLs** (desktop + mobile) and a **scannable QR code** automatically.

### Or run in the terminal (CLI)

```bash
python main.py
```

## App UI

The web app provides a full chat interface:

- 💬 **Message bubbles** — user messages on the right, Taran on the left
- 📱 **Access button** — shows your mobile URL and QR code at any time
- 📋 **Abilities button** — lists all of Taran's current skills
- 🗑️ **Clear button** — wipe the conversation history
- ⌨️ **Enter to send** · **Shift+Enter** for multi-line messages
- 🔄 **Typing indicator** — animated dots while Taran is thinking

### REST API

The app also exposes a simple API for integrations:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Chat page |
| `POST` | `/chat` | Send `{"message": "..."}`, get `{"response": "..."}` |
| `GET` | `/history` | Full conversation history |
| `POST` | `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `GET` | `/abilities` | Taran's abilities catalogue |
| `GET` | `/access` | Returns `local_url`, `mobile_url`, and `qr_ascii` |
